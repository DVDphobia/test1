# Tailwind CSS compiler

Compiles your CSS Tailwind file from classes found in your source code.

To initialize, you must have Node.js installed on your machine. Then, `cd` into this directory and run `npm install` to install all dependencies.

When that's done, head to `../scripts/compile_tailwind.sh` to compile the CSS.
